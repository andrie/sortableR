# sortable (development version)

Breaking changes:

* Moved the `...` dots argument of `sortable_options()` to the first argument,
where previously it was the last argument. This is to prevent partial name
matching resulting in the incorrect sortable option being set.

Other:

* Added examples for using the `sortable.js` plugins, specifically multiDrag and
swap.
